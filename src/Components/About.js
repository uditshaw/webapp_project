          The basic idea behind this project was to initially create a
          centralized space where the administrators could publish the events
          they would be organizing and the users could register themselves. It
          makes a hassle-free experience and furthermore makes it a one-stop
          destination to know anything and everything going in and around KIIT.

          This project can be used in the real-world in a very practical way
          which can serve numerous people in different ways at different levels.
          Apart from institution level, if it is implemented in a district-wide
          or state-wide level with proper resources, it can cater to a larger
          audience and make the hosting and advertisement of events extremely
          easy.
